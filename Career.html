          <h2>Other information</h2>
          <p>To become an I.T it takes a lot of time and training to get the basics and then to get better at each so you can use them in the real world <br>
          but once you learn the basics it is so much fun learning the rest you wont even know where the time went and they are usefull. <br>
          You can make tons of money depending on the position and the rank and what job some jobs are harder than others though. <br>
           If I were to pick I would like a job where I get a good amount of money but not too stressfull.</p>
